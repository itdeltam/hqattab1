# trading_bot

A 24/7 autonomous algorithmic trading system for US equities/ETFs (long-only,
diversified trend/momentum), built on Alpaca, SQLite/SQLAlchemy, and FastAPI.

Built stage by stage; see `BUILD ORDER` in the project brief. **Stage 1
(scaffolding, config, mode switch) is done.** Stages 2-12 are not implemented
yet.

## Safety model (non-negotiable, see project brief for full list)

- Three modes: `PAPER` (default), `APPROVAL`, `LIVE`. The app never
  auto-switches itself into LIVE.
- Starting the app in `LIVE` mode requires typing `ENABLE LIVE TRADING`
  exactly, after being shown account, equity, and risk limits. See
  `app/startup.py`.
- No secrets are hardcoded or logged. All credentials come from `.env`
  (see `.env.example`), which is git-ignored.

## Setup

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env       # then fill in real values
```

**Before any real trading**, edit `.env` and set real numbers for
`STARTING_CAPITAL` and `MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT` (and the other risk limits) — the
defaults in `.env.example` are placeholders, not recommendations.

## Run

```powershell
python -m app.main
```

In `PAPER` or `APPROVAL` mode this starts immediately. In `LIVE` mode it
will print an account/risk-limit banner and block on a typed confirmation.

On Windows, `start_trader.bat` wraps this for use with NSSM (auto-start /
auto-restart) — see the comment header in that file.

## Test

```powershell
pytest
```

`tests/test_startup_safety.py` is the load-bearing test suite for Stage 1:
it asserts PAPER/APPROVAL never prompt, and LIVE mode refuses to proceed
without the exact typed confirmation phrase.
